Expense-Tracker_fullstack
Creating a fullstack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and Node.js) application for tracking my expenses.
Problem: lack of insight into personal spending habits and financial allocations. 
To address this problem, I'm creating an application capable of tracking expenses by facilitating the creation and management of expenses, as well as providing features for viewing and analyzing expenses over time.
